# DepthEstimation

This library provides simple, user-facing APIs for estimating depth from stereo images and stereo video streams.

The library abstracts away internal image processing and stereo matching details, exposing only high-level estimator classes.

## Supported Modes

- Stereo depth from image pairs
- Stereo depth from video streams
